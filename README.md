# Movie Analysis, Final Project Module 1

	This project contains four Jupyter Notebooks used to analyze data from multiple data bases in order to provide reccomendations to 
Microsoft who is looking to get in on the movie industry with original content. Three Jupyter Notebooks contain data from each 
the Rotten Tomatoes, The Numbers, and IMDb data bases. Below is a summary of each notebook. 

# Cleaning Data_Rotten Tomato
  * This data set contains data from the Rotten Tomato database. This notebook uses methods to search more missing values and visualize
outliers in the data. This notebook also makes use of dummy variables that are useful for finding relationships in qualitative data. 

# Cleaning Data_The Numbers
  * This data is mostly quantitative data about finances of the movies that have been released including but not limited to, production 
budget and movie gross. This notebook highlights the use of feature engineering to conduct 'column math' and concatenate columns onto 
existing data frames.

# Cleaning Data_IMDb
  * This data set consists of mostly qualitative data including personel such as actors and directors inolved in production of the movie.
The methods highlighted in this notebook are related to removing outliers using interquartile range (IQR) and visualizations such as 
boxplots and histograms. 

# Data Visualizations
  * This notebook combines all of the cleaned data from the databases listed above. In this notebook exploratory data analysis is 
carried out using summary statistics along with visualizations such as pairplots, distributions, and bar graphs along with linear 
regression to gain insight into the strength of various relationships and come to some conclusions about the data.


# Enjoy!
